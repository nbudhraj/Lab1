## Sports

Ever since I was young, I always had a passion for sports, especially soccer and basketball. As a result, I have become an avid NBA fan, and in particular, I have been a die-hard **Golden-State Warriors** fan since birth.

Recently, I have become quite interested in **the _intersection_ of Sports and Tech**. This year [Dapper Labs](https://www.dapperlabs.com/), a block-chain company, partened with the NBA to develop [NBA Topshot](https://nbatopshot.com/), a marketplace that sells NFTs of NBA highlights as collectables. Here is an interesting quote from a CNBC article discussing NBA Topshot in which Tom Richardson, a professor in digital media at Columbia University, speaks on the popularity of NBA Topshot:

>“'One of the things that have defined the digital era is we’ve moved from a world of scarcity to a world of abundance with all kinds of media assets and products,' he added. 'But the thing that defines the trading card business is a physical scarcity of the cards. So (Dapper) created these NFTs with the idea of scarcity combined with authenticity because of the way the blockchain works.'” [Citation](/citations.md)

## Programming 

Obviously, as CS major, I have a strong passion for programming. I started learning programming through mobile development, and from there I grew a passion for developing applications. This past summer I worked on an iOS application that attempted to detect negative words in speech using Apple's Speech Recognition and Machine Learning frameworks. Here is a code snippet from this project. This snippet contains a simple UIButton I developed that acted as the start-stop feature in recording and recognizing someone's speech.

```
 @IBAction func btn_start_stop(_ sender: UIButton) {
        isStart = !isStart
               if isStart {
                    startSpeechRecognization()
                    self.arrWord = [String]()
                    btn.setTitle("STOP", for: .normal)
               } else {
                   cancelSpeechRecognization()
                   btn.setTitle("START", for: .normal)
               }
    }

```
