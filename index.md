# About Me

My name is Navika Budhraja and I'm a second year computer science major at the [University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/). Some of my hobbies include 

- [Sports](#sports)
- [Music] (#music)
- Programming 
- Spending time with friends and family!

### Sports

Ever since I was young, I have always loved sports, particularly soccer and basketball. As a result, I have become an avid NBA fan, and specifically, I have been a die-hard Golden-State Warriors fan since birth.

Recently, I have become quite interested in the *intersection* of Sports and Tech. This year [Dapper Labs](https://www.dapperlabs.com/), a block-chain gaming company, partened with the NBA to develop [NBA Topshot](https://nbatopshot.com/), a marketplace that sells NFTs of NBA highlights as collectables. Here is an interesting quote CNBC in which Tom Richardson, a professor in digital media at Columbia University, speaks on the captivating nature of the product:
>“'One of the things that have defined the digital era is we’ve moved from a world of scarcity to a world of abundance with all kinds of media assets and products,' he added. 'But the thing that defines the trading card business is a physical scarcity of the cards. So (Dapper) created these NFTs with the idea of scarcity combined with authenticity because of the way the blockchain works.'” [Citation]


### Music 

With my freetime, I love listening to music and learning about music production. Here is a list of some of my favorite albums of all time!

1. Revenge of the Dreamers
